 ------------Get Started---------------
 Why we do these at the top:

 * {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

 Each browser has its own 'default' CSS values for each element type. Using the universal selector * to reset margins and padding to 0 removes any cross-browser inconsistencies that may result from the different default CSS values.
