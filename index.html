            I see many people stress about where to get a logo. Sometimes they
            pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars (that they don't have) and
            want it to be perfect first time around. Hey, I get it. I am all for
            high quality. Let's simplify this too, shall we?

          <h2><i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-v"> Marketing</i></h2>
          <p>Marketing is one of your most important organizing tools. There are four basic aspects of marketing, often called the "four P's":
            • Product - the item or service you sell
            • Price - the amount you charge for your product or service.
            • Promote - the ways you inform your market as to who, what and where you are
            • Provide - the channels you use to take the product to the customer.

          <h2><i class="fab fa-gg-circle"> Advertising</i></h2>
          <p>Advertising is a way of marketing your business in order to increase sales or make your audience aware of your products or services. Until a customer deals with you directly and actually buys your products or services, your advertising may help to form their first impressions of your business.</p>

          <h2><i class="fas fa-chart-bar"> Logo</i></h2>
          <p>Logos are a point of identification; they're the symbol that customers use to recognize your brand. Ideally, you'll want people to instantly connect the sight of your logo with the memory of what your company does – and, more importantly, how it makes them feel.</p>
